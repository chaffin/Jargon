# &cong; Congruent
A collaborative review process to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and promote oringinal intent.

A **Congruent** paper is not considered an original work, but instead an **interpreted work** of rules, regulations, etc. This interpreted work is the author's Draft. The author must find a peer to review thier works and collaborate the paper into an **Accordant** version. This Accordant paper is submitted and remains Accordant until reviewed by another peer in collaboration with the Author and Accordant Author. If the document survives the scrutiny it becomes Congruent.

## Draft


## Accordant


## Congruent


## Congruous
Over time a paper can gain Conguency with collaboration between either the *Draft, Accordant or Congruent* authors.
