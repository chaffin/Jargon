# Jargon|järˈgən 
A technical framework that enables authors to write more concise sentences and phrases for their works. [Jargon](http://myword.io/users/LarryChaffin/essays/001.html) statements read like nonsensical jumble of words; however, when applied to an author’s written statement, clarifies the author’s intent and makes it more comprehensible.

## Introduction
Jargon is a plain text format that is easy-to-write and easy-to-read. The design goal for Jargon's formatting syntax, is to make it as readable as possible with very few special characters. The idea is that a Jargon formatted sentence and/or paragraph should accompany the real-text it represents, or should be linked as a reference.

Jargon grew out of frustration with poorly written rules and instructions, which frequently lead to misinterpretations and/or completely incorrect implementations. Often, the misunderstanding of a sentence or phrase comes down to one "word", a single morpheme. Morphemes are single words that can enhance the understanding of an author’s written statement.

The best way to learn how to Jargon is to simply read the below rules, and then write some for yourself.

## Jargon Rules
The examples below offer a basic insight into Jargon by outlining `[nine|9]` frame rules; yes, that is a Jargon **frame** in action. Jargon is framed by brackets and held together by a few simple rules. Jargon is not dependent on CAPS or ~~Markup~~. Jargon does not place *emphasis* in italics or **bold** text. Jargon is all about [itself:see paragraph heading]. 

### 1. Rule frame [morpheme] 

There are `[morpheme]` that Jargon recognizes as beneficial to always frame. The author has the option to add more or less to ensure their work is comprehensible. This rule states that the morpheme's `[and], [but], [if], [no], [not], [or], [will]` are all identified by Jargon as key morphemes that should be framed, `[or not]`.   

### 2. Rule frame [morpheme:define] 
Sometimes a word means something to one person, and something different to another. This frame rule allows the author to add a few `[words:not greater than four]` to ensure the meaning. Yes, that is Jargon defining the maximum number of words to use when applying this rule.

### 3. Rule frame [#morpheme]
Jargon is [not] intended to `[#create]` fluffy bloated `[#sentences]`. This rule allows the `[#author]` to hash-tag words for use latter in the same `[writing|#sentences]` to make `[their|#author]` statements more clear [and] `[show|#create]` relationships within the sentence [or] paragraph.  

### 4. Rule frame [morpheme|#morpheme]
Tagging a morpheme with a hash in rule three is much like `[#setting]` a variable. As the reader moves along a sentence they [will] find the hash tagged morpheme again, and realize that the author is `[linking|#setting]` a relationship. 

### 5. Rule frame [morpheme|related]
This Jargon rule frame is `[similar|related]` to rule `[two|2]` with emphasis on related. There are  `[6|six]` Jargon frames within this rule that fully `[displays|shows]` this rule frame in action. The reader [will] `[notice|see]` the relationships to fully `[understand|realize]` the authors intent.

### 6. Rule frame [morpheme(synonym)]
This rule frame `[necessitates(requires)]` the morpheme contains its synonym. Doing so allows the `[author(writer)]` to `[hone(sharpen)]` their words to ensure meaning is clearly understood. Do [not]  `[error(mistake)]` this rule with rule frame [5|five], which they are [not] related. 

### 7. Rule frame [morpheme|related(synonym)]
This rule frame `[combines|adds(appends)]` rule frames five [and] six. There is nothing better to `[say|talk(verbalize)]` about it. 

### 8. Rule frame [morpheme|~unrelated]
This rule frame is the opposite of rule frame five. The `[author|~reader]` chooses the morpheme to negate, rather than frame. This rule allows the author to completely rule-out any stray thoughts the reader may form while understanding the work. Remember, Jargon `[rules|~recommendations]`.

### 9. Rule frame [morpheme|*example]
There are some morphemes that require examples to make a point. This frame rule relies on `[short|*small,*quickly stated,*pointed]` examples to frame a morpheme more clearly. Unlike rule frame two, this rule frame is not defined but rather an example, which is similar to the grammar rule that utilizes "Latin e.g." when one is not intending to list everything. A better example of this rule would be the following:

> System administrators conduct privileged `[functions|*add users*install software]` for the system.   

### Using Jargon
As stated in the introduction, Jargon grew out of frustration with poorly written rules [and] instructions. Therefore, it stands to reason that Jargon would satisfy rule [and] requirement statements. 

For example, A Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) [or] Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL).  Regardless the technology [or] application, Jargon remains a plain text grammar tool, [not] program tool. Meaning that Jargon would go anywhere humans read.

Going back to STIGs. A STIG is a methodology for standardizing secure installations [and] maintenance of computer software [and] hardware. So it would be [no] surprise to learn that STIGs play a large role in cybersecurity, which ensures the hardening [and] protection of computer networks [and] information systems. Therefore, it would be important to follow the rules. 

Below is an example of one STIG check found in the STIG for Applications that I believe is well written [but] may be difficult to follow for some [readers:self assessors]. 

See for yourself how adding Jargon makes a [huge|large] difference with this STIG rule [and] checks. 

### Examples

**Rule:** V-6146 — (APP3270: CAT I) The designer will ensure the application has the capability to mark sensitive/classified output when required.

**Rule with Jargon**  
V-6146 — (APP3270: CAT I) The designer [will] [ensure:make certain] the application has the capability to [#mark:per DoDM 5200.01-V2] sensitive/classified [output|display:visually on monitor|printed:hard copy] [when:if] [required|#mark].

**First Rule Check**  
1) If appropriate markings are not present within the application and it is technically possible to have the markings present, it is a finding.

**First Rule Check with Jargon**  
1) [if:on the condition] appropriate [markings:Per DOD 5200.02] are [not] present [#within] the application [and] [it:to have markings] is [technically:by application design] possible to have the markings [present|#within], [it:result] is a [finding|vulnerability|CAT I].

**Second Rule Check**  
2) If it is not technically feasible to meet the minimum marking requirement and no user procedures exist or if followed the procedures will result in incorrect markings, or the procedures are not readily available to users, it is a finding.

**Second Rule Check with Jargon**  
2) [If:on the condition] it is [not] [technically:by application design] [feasible(possible)] to [meet|satisfy] the minimum [#marking:per DoDM 5200.01-V2] requirement [and] [no] user [#procedures:documented steps] exist [or] [if] followed the [#procedures] [will] result in [incorrect|erroneous|wrong] [markings|#marking], [or] the [#procedures] are [not] [readily|quickly(speedily)] available to users, [it|result] is a [finding|vulnerability|CAT I].

Thank you for [reading|learning] about Jargon.
